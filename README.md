# Price Alert

## Motivation

One of my hobbies is buying and selling makeup. Makeup has a heavy mark up, and
the beauty industry pushes layers of products. A full set 
of makeup for someone who uses every product type could easily cost $200+.

I wrote a set of Python scripts to scrape makeup buy/sell sites daily,
write to a local PostgreSQL database, query the database and process 


## Stack and Third Party Software

- Python 3.11
- Beautiful Soup
- Amazon Free Tier (EC2, SNS)
- Apache HTTP Web Server
